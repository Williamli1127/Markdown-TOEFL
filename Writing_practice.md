From my own perspective, all the creatures lived on earth need a life purpose to suvive , and humankind is no exception.
In ancient times, people went hunting and farming to collect and produce food in order to sustain their lives. At that time, when people hunted a giant prey that could supply as food for the whole tribe, they could get the sense of accomplishment.
Similarly,with the advance of technologies , when people had suffiecient time to do other activities other than laboring for a living, rich people with suffiecient resources had the ability enjoying the fruits without laboring might start to find a specific leisure activitiy to focus on and put much efforts in it because the sense of accomplishment can't be substitued.
Moreover, due to having more wealth and wider vision among arts and all kind of entertainments, rich people tend to pursue high quality life, in which fame and social status are significantly important.
As a result, they don't want the label of being a useless rich person without prooductivities , then striving to work harder or beginning to run a bussiness on their own as a chief executives. With such movements, they can accordingly get more fame and higher social staus.
All of the evidence above describes the most common traits of humankind, greed.
What we do and what we think in everyday life has a related goal and interest, while rich people are human as well, so they also require something to chase after and the need to be satisfied ,such as the infinite greedy intension deeply inside.
To sum up, even rich people do need to work or they will be unhappy.

Based on my own experience and perspective, I think that borrowing or lending money from friends is not a clever decision.
First of all, it is always difficult to tell your friends returning money because the foundation of relationship between you and your friend might be quite different from interest. That is, they might have something in common or match to each other concerning some entertainments, while the reason why most of them become friends have nothing to do with money. Otherwise, they can be only business partner but not intimate friends. Accordingly, ask your friend to return money is somewhat weird and thus being hard to say.
Secondly, take running a business with friends as an instance, when it comes to money and benefits, everyone to some degree become self-defending and selfish due to the inner sin of greed. As a result, it is often said that 'don't work with your family or friends', because it is hard to balance in work and personal life concerning money. Similarly, borrowing and lending money also can be identified as business work, so it is not recommended to do so between friends.
Last but not least, given that friendship is significantly valued in my life, I would definitely not want to deteriorate it through any possible means. For example, having a money issue with them is one of the terrible approach to break down friendship beacause when it comes to being a friend, they may have same value and goal as I am, but when it comes to money, thay can have opposite value from me.
To sum up, it is without a doubt that borrowing money from a friend is the worst option while it can destroy a stable relationship in a minute and things always get complicated when it comes to money between friends. Accordingly, trying to borrow money from any person except your friends will be the smartest way.

According to the lecture, the professor indicates that the factors that contributes to the fluctation of bobwhite's population are much more complex than the mentioned contents in the passage.
To begin with, providing a small scale of land as bobwhite's habitat is not suffiecient enough to their survival. For instance, if they are provided isolated areas, the increase of bobwhite's will not be improved. Relatively, they should preserve some lands that are across reginal border so that bobwhite's can move without barrierss.
Secondly, overhunting might not be the major factor that deteriorate the population of bobwhite due to their ability of being prolific breeders. Once given satisfied habitats, they can reproduce successfully and thus have a growth of population, in which contributes to their short life cycle.
Last but not least, the professor reputes the idea of breeding quails individually and then releasing them to the wild because bobwhite has inferior gene compared to other species so that they cann't grow well in the wild. Moreover, the professor suggests that the appropriate measure is to breed them in an abundant habitat and then transfer them by a huge amount to the other places where they can survive comfortably.
